KPI's requirement
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance.
Specifically, we want to calculate the following matches:

2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue 
by the total number of orders
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed
5. Average Pizzas per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of 
pizzas sold by the total number of orders

identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
